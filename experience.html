Right after highschool, my life's a roller coaster ride.
<br>I slowly started to lose one after one of my family member.
<br>starting from my father, then my mother. And recently my sister.
<br>Life is tough, but i have to keep going. Become independent and gained working experience right after school 
<br>definitely give good advantage for me, since i can practice what i have learn in my daily life.
<br>So 3 years ago, i aimed to pursue my dreams which is getting a higher education. 
<br>I managed to finished my diploma. And now i got to further my degree.
<br>Thought im gonna be all alone on this journey but Allah is Great, 
<br>I found a sweet foster family who is so caring and loving to go through this journey together.
<br> The experience that i have gain throughout my life makes me better in many aspects.
<br>Allah is Great, Allah is Great, Allah is Great!
