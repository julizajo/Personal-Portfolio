<br>
<b>After highschool, i got selected to joined a camp for 3 months in PLKN Princess Haliza in Sepang back in 2014. 
<br>While in there, I've learnt how to survive a night in the forest with limited supply. I also learn shooting and swimming. 
<br>I have become more tougher and braver right after i joined the camp.
<br>
<br>
After that, i got work offer at a fine dining restaurant in Subang Jaya in 2016-2017.
<br> I gain a lot of knowledge and experience of how to serve and dealing with customer, handle large booking for events or gathering. 
<br>the main mission is to make sure the customer are satisfied with the service to keep a good name of the restaurant.
<br>I have received a certificate for being the best employee.
<br>
<br>
In 2017, I got offer to study in UiTM Jengka, Diploma in office Management & Technology in 2017 and graduate in 2020.
<br> During diploma year, i manage to get knowlegde of microsoft and typing skills.
<br>So that is some of my experience after highschool!
